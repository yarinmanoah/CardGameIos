**War Card Game**

In this engaging card game for iOS, players compete against the computer in a classic "War" card battle. Each player is dealt a card randomly from a standard deck (A-K), and the player with the higher card wins the round and earns a point. The game continues for 10 rounds, and the player with the most points at the end wins.

Key Features:
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Players and the computer draw cards randomly and simultaneously. The cards are displayed for 3 seconds before being flipped over.
- **Round Outcomes**: In case of a tie in card values, nothing happens. No points are awarded.
- **Winning Conditions**: The game lasts for 10 rounds. The player with the most points at the end wins. In case of a tie in points, the "house" wins.
- **User Positioning**: The player's position is dynamically set based on their locationâ€”right side for users in the east, left side for users in the west.

This intuitive and fun card game offers an enjoyable and competitive experience for all ages.
